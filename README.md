### Regular Expression Solutions

Brief description of the command line options.

| Option | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| [-/]f | input-file-name | indicates the input file from which to draw match candidates |
| [-/]pcre | | signals whether to use PCRE for regex |
| | regex-pattern | free standing regular expression patterns |

Regular expression patterns are the default expected option at any given position. An input file may occur anywhere on the command line. Same for whether to use PCRE.

Additional baked in regex examples were included for demo purposes only.
